| c. | Analyze the difference between chronological and functional formats in résumé writing, specifying when each should be preferred. | 2 | 2 |
| d. | Critically evaluate the significance of networking in building professional relationships for career advancement. | 2 | 2 |
| e. | Determine how the structure of a technical proposal differs when pitching to technical experts versus non-technical stakeholders. | 2 | 3 |
| f. | Assess how leadership communication style must adapt during organizational crisis situations. | 2 | 4 |
| g. | Distinguish between Jung's introverted thinking and extraverted thinking functions in personality assessment and their impact on workplace communication. | 2 | 5 |

## SECTION B

2. Attempt any three of the following:                                       **7 x 3 = 21**

| Q no. | Question | Marks | CO |
|-------|----------|-------|-----|
| a. | The 7 C's of communication are often deemed sufficient, but contemporary technical communication scholars argue for additional principles. Critically analyze the limitations of the 7 C's framework and propose extensions that address modern technical communication challenges. | 7 | 1 |
| b. | Compare and contrast the rhetorical strategies required for writing an effective Statement of Purpose (SOP) versus those needed for a research paper abstract. Provide analytical insights on how audience expectations influence the construction of each document. | 7 | 2 |
| c. | Technical proposals often fail at the ideation stage due to ineffective pitching techniques. Critically examine the psychological, linguistic, and presentational factors that distinguish successful technical pitches from unsuccessful ones. | 7 | 3 |
| d. | Analyze the intersection between emotional intelligence and critical thinking in technical leadership. How do these seemingly contradictory skill sets complement each other in resolving complex technical communication problems? | 7 | 4 |
| e. | Evaluate how ethical considerations in digital content creation have evolved with emerging technologies. Critically analyze the challenges of maintaining authenticity while optimizing content for algorithmic distribution across various platforms. | 7 | 5 |

## SECTION C

3. Attempt any one part of the following:                                    **7 x 1 = 7**

| Q no. | Question | Marks | CO |
|-------|----------|-------|-----|
| a. | "The stimulus-response model of communication is fundamentally inadequate for explaining technical communication in complex organizational structures." Critically analyze this statement and propose an alternative theoretical framework that better addresses technical communication complexities. | 7 | 1 |
| b. | Examine how paralinguistic features can compensate for semantic ambiguities in technical explanations. Analyze specific scenarios where tone modulation significantly alters the interpretation of technical information. | 7 | 1 |

4. Attempt any one part of the following:                                    **7 x 1 = 7**

Analyze your rhetorical choices in addressing multiple stakeholders including researchers, industry professionals, and students. | 7 | 2 |
| b. | A multinational engineering firm has invited applications for its global leadership program. As a final-year engineering student, draft a persuasive and distinctive Statement of Purpose that demonstrates your technical expertise, leadership potential, and intercultural competence. Include a critical reflection on your rhetorical strategies. | 7 | 2 |

5. Attempt any one part of the following:                                    **7 x 1 = 7**

| Q no. | Question | Marks | CO |
|-------|----------|-------|-----|
